# Derivatives

## Goal of the Problem Set

The student should understand the derivative as a rate of change and the slope of a tangent line, and should be able to apply the basic differentiation rules: the sum rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and derivatives of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

Obtaining a formula for the derivative is not the end of the task. The student should be able to explain **why a particular rule is being used** and, in at least some problems, connect the result with slope, the sign of the derivative, or a simple verification.

## Basic Problems

### Problem 1. Derivative of a Polynomial and the Slope of a Tangent Line
For
$$f(x)=3x^5-2x^3+7x-4$$
find $f'(x)$. Then compute $f'(0)$ and $f'(1)$, determine the signs of the obtained values, and explain what they say about the slope of the tangent line to the graph at these two points.

> **Why this problem:** it reinforces the power rule and connects the value of the derivative at a point with the geometric meaning of the tangent slope.

### Problem 2. Powers, Roots, and the Domain
For
$$f(x)=2\sqrt{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}+x^{3/2}$$
1. rewrite the function using powers,
2. determine the domain,
3. compute the derivative,
4. compare the domain of the function with the domain of its derivative.

> **Why this problem:** it teaches how to rewrite different forms so that the power rule can be applied and how to keep track of the domain.

### Problem 3. The Product Rule — Why Is It Needed?
For
$$f(x)=(x^2+1)e^x$$
compute the derivative. Then compare the correct result with the incorrect idea
$$f'(x)\stackrel{?}{=}(2x)e^x$$
and explain which term is missing.

> **Why this problem:** it teaches the product rule by analyzing a common mistake.

### Problem 4. A Quotient and Domain Control
For
$$f(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x-1}$$
determine the domain, compute the derivative, simplify the result, and explain why the restriction $x\neq1$ remains important.

> **Why this problem:** it practices the quotient rule together with domain control.

### Problem 5. The Chain Rule as Working Through Layers
For
$$f(x)=(3x^2-2x+1)^5$$
identify the inner and outer functions, compute their derivatives, and combine the result according to the chain rule. Explain the origin of the additional factor.

> **Why this problem:** it teaches how to recognize the structure of a composition instead of memorizing the rule as a meaningless pattern.

### Problem 6. Product Rule and Trigonometry
For
$$f(x)=x\sin x+\cos x$$
compute the derivative and simplify the result. Then compute $f'(0)$ and interpret the direction of the tangent line at that point.

> **Why this problem:** it combines the product rule with trigonometric derivatives and geometric interpretation.

### Problem 7. A Trigonometric Composition
For
$$f(x)=\sin(x^2+1)$$
compute the derivative. Explicitly identify the outer function, the inner function, and the derivative of the inner function. Finally, determine the sign of $f'(0)$.

> **Why this problem:** it reinforces the chain rule in a different type of composition.

### Problem 8. Two Exponential Functions
For
$$f(x)=e^{2x-3}+5^x$$
compute the derivative. Explain why the factor $2$ appears in the first term and why $\ln5$ appears in the second.

> **Why this problem:** it organizes two different mechanisms that produce additional factors.

### Problem 9. A Logarithm and the Chain Rule
For
$$f(x)=\ln(x^2+1)$$
compute the derivative. Then determine the sign of $f'(x)$ for $x<0$, $x=0$, and $x>0$, and describe qualitatively how the function behaves around zero.

> **Why this problem:** it connects differentiation with sign analysis and the behavior of a function.

### Problem 10. The Tangent Line as an Application of the Derivative
For
$$f(x)=x^2-3x+1$$
find the equation of the tangent line at the point with $x=2$. Give the point of tangency, the value $f'(2)$, the equation of the line, and verify that the point lies on the obtained tangent line.

> **Why this problem:** it combines the derivative and the equation of a line into a complete geometric problem.

## More Difficult Problems

### Problem 11. Derivative from the Definition
Using only
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}h,$$
find the derivative of $f(x)=x^2$. Compare the result with the power rule and indicate where the limit is used in the calculation.

> **Why this problem:** it shows the origin of the power rule and the direct connection between the derivative and a limit.

### Problem 12. Several Rules at Once
For
$$f(x)=(x^2+1)^3e^x$$
compute the derivative. Before calculating, write down a plan: which rule applies to the whole expression and which rule applies to one of its factors. Finally, organize the result by factoring out common factors.

> **Why this problem:** it practices the order of decisions when combining familiar differentiation rules.

### Problem 13. A Multi-Layer Composition
For
$$f(x)=e^{\sin(x^2)}$$
compute the derivative. First write the layers
$$x\longrightarrow x^2\longrightarrow \sin(x^2)\longrightarrow e^{\sin(x^2)}$$
and explain why differentiation moves through them in the reverse order.

> **Why this problem:** it develops the chain rule as a method for working with multiple layers.

### Problem 14. Continuity and Differentiability of a Piecewise Function
Investigate the behavior at $x=0$ of
$$f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2,&x\ge0,\\ax,&x<0.\end{cases}$$
For which values of $a$ is the function continuous? For which values do the one-sided derivatives exist and agree? For which value of $a$ is the function differentiable? Explain why continuity alone is not sufficient.

> **Why this problem:** it requires an organized argument and a clear distinction between two concepts.

### Problem 15. The Difference Quotient as a Check of the Derivative
Choose one function from the problem set and a point $x_0$ at which the derivative exists. Compute $f'(x_0)$ exactly, and then calculate
$$\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}h$$
for $h=1$, $0.1$, and $0.01$. Compare the values with $f'(x_0)$ and explain why the difference quotient approaching a single number is consistent with the definition of the derivative, while a few computations do not replace a limit argument.

> **Why this problem:** it connects the definition of the derivative with concrete calculations and teaches the distinction between observation and proof.
